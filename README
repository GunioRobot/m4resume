BASIC INVOCATION:

bin/build.sh > output/resume.tex             [output to LaTeX by default]
bin/build.sh -Dmode=html |elinks -force-html [To view HTML mode]

ARTIFACTS:

In output directory (resume.pdf from resume.tex)

DOCUMENTATION:

None as yet.  In the doc directory there are my notes from reading the GNU M4
manual though.


CONTENTS:

README     : this file
bin        : place for build executibles
doc        : place for notes I took on GNU M4 and scratch test set
metaprog   : M4 is awesome for MP, some sketches to help flesh that out quickly
output     : sample output (check out resume.pdf)
src        : M4 sources (referenced in build.sh)

RDFa SUPPORT

If -Dmode=html and -Ddo_rdfa are set at build, m4 resume will take specialized
tokens of the form "__RDFA_plain_text_term" and will look for its definition.
These are defined in 'defs.m4' in the associative array "RDFa_tokens".  When
the format is non-RDFa-compliant (LaTeX / HTML) the __RDFA_ prefix will be
stripped, the '_'s, will be turned to spaces and thus a simple text view will
be provided.

In the event that the definition exists in the associative array, the value
will be returned.  Thus something like __RDFA_Saint_Tropez becomes "Saint
Tropez" in LaTeX or HTML, but becomes <a cite="...">Saint Tropez</a> in
HTML+RDFa mode.

formatting was nice, clean, and thoroughly theft-worthy.
