PURPOSE

A resume is a many-splendored thing that everyon KNOWS they should keep
up-to-date but which no one likes to do.  Even more vexing is that there are
varying formats HTML, and LaTeX are two obvious formats.  Even- Even more
vexing that _that_ is that it is now possible to semantically mark-up HTML
résumés so that they allow the web of data to know more about you.

Essentially you need a way to enter simple text structures that can expand out
to more complex text structures.  Take the simple IN on one stream, set the
complex OUT on another.  Instead of using Ruby or Lisp or some other
heavier-weight language, I use M4.  It's both arcane and perfect for the job.

Ergo m4resume.

BASIC INVOCATION:

bin/build.sh > output/resume.tex             [output to LaTeX by default]
bin/build.sh -Dmode=html |elinks -force-html [To view HTML mode]

( these commands are wrapped by many of the commands in the bin/ directory.
e.g. lview builds LaTeX and then views it after pdflatex-ing it )

ARTIFACTS:

In output directory (resume.pdf from resume.tex)

DOCUMENTATION:

None as yet.  In the doc directory there are my notes from reading the GNU M4
manual though.


CONTENTS:

README     : this file
bin        : place for build executables
doc        : place for notes I took on GNU M4 and scratch test set
metaprog   : M4 is awesome for MP, some sketches to help flesh that out quickly
output     : sample output (check out resume.pdf)
src        : M4 sources (referenced in build.sh)

RDFa SUPPORT

If -Dmode=html and -Ddo_rdfa are set at build, m4 resume will take specialized
tokens of the form "__RDFA_plain_text_term" and will look for its definition.
These are defined in 'defs.m4' in the associative array "RDFa_tokens".  When
the format is non-RDFa-compliant (LaTeX / HTML) the __RDFA_ prefix will be
stripped, the '_'s, will be turned to spaces and thus a simple text view will
be provided.

In the event that the definition exists in the associative array, the value
will be returned.  Thus something like __RDFA_Saint_Tropez becomes "Saint
Tropez" in LaTeX or HTML, but becomes <a cite="...">Saint Tropez</a> in
HTML+RDFa mode.

REQUIRES:

I use GNU M4.  Other M4's may work or may not work, depending on how
complicated  your code is and which functions you assume as builtins.

THANKS:

<a href="http://www.mcnabbs.org/andrew/">Andrew McNabb</a> whose LaTeX
formatting was nice, clean, and thoroughly theft-worthy.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

The sample output of the sgharms_example branch can be found at
http://stevengharms.com.

* <a href="http://stevengharms.com/resume.html">HTML+RDFa resume for Steven Harms</a> as generated by this program. 
* <a href="http://stevengharms.com/resume.rdf">RDF</a> resume for Steven Harms as distilled from the above.  
* <a href="http://stevengharms.com/resume.pdf">PDF</a> resume for Steven Harms as created from LaTeX generated by m4resume.  

It may be instructive to look at the sgharms_example, it's a bit more richly
customized and may give you some ideas on where to take the master -- or you
can just hack it to make it match your resume details.  The latter is probably
mo' convenient. ;-)
