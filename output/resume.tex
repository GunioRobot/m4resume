  \section*{Personal Statement}
  I love learning and experimentation.  I draw on a background that includes philosophy, business, classics, code, and nine years of industry experience to provide innovative solutions, to ask non-obvious questions, and to push the boundaries of what is perceived as possible.

\subsection*{Cisco Systems : Senior I.T. Engineer: Communication and Collaboration Platform}
  \label{ciscosystems_rdfa_cisco_recent_title:_rdfa_cisco_recent_desc}
  2005-04--2009-07
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Authored 5–point, 2–year legacy systems migration strategy to move all backbone mail services to a standardized, turnkey environment.  Implementation completed 2008}
    \item{Led technical team responsible forum and blogging framework deployment}
    \item{Created business requirements document and RESTful API specification for new generic list-abstraction repository and interface: allows disparate downstream systems (including mail) to access and utilize the same list structures for mail, calendar, voice mail, meeting invite, etc.  Implemented 2009-05}
    \item{Created standard specification for all applications environments with respect to standard, accepted mail routing behavior: policy document, Sendmail.mc for Solaris, Linux}
    \item{Created registry process and web tool for application host systems that use e-mail as transport layer. This should help identify / remediate non-compliant systems that are using our data through unsupported interfaces so that we can help them come into compliance}
    \item{Wrote script to deploy core mailing list host data repository, web interface, mail interface, and build scripts from M4 macro definitions + Bash + Perl. This allows an entire environment to be built and deployed into a segregated space by configuring a single macro specification file}
    \item{Collaborated with University of Texas  Information, Risk, and Operations Management Management Information Systems steering committee to specify next generation of skill-set foci}
    \item{Through efforts in the previous 6 years, reduced head-count to 1 full time employee and a vendor team.  Realized net savings in excess of 320,000USD}

  2001-04--2005-06
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Member of 5-person team changed with  backbone mail systems upon which ~1bn/month mail flow.  Build anti-spam, anti-malware solution}
    \item{Managed fleet of 10 HP servers, a dozen Mirapoint appliances}
    \item{Migrated legacy environment of spool-based and Mirapoint-based clients to Exchange 2000}
    \item{Designed Out of Office scanner / handler to prevent MS Exchange from feeding spam engines / spamming external mailing lists / causing infinite mail storm loops due to its "everyone gets a bounce" design}
    \item{Established messaging team standard Perl module set / CVS repository / Subversion repository}
    \item{Built common framework for Sendmail-based processing, filtration, and re-routing.  Built 3 special-use appliances using single polymorphic code base.  Available at Google Code {\bf CMailguard} Project}
    \item{Built software solutions for turnkey rebuild of core infrastructure components to increase resiliency in event of attrition or disaster.  Build entire deploy suite in M4 which allowed customization to disaster environment by changing fewer than 10 values}
    \item{Migrated primary web interface for list data repository from non–validating HTML 4 Frameset specification to XHTML–compliant, CSS–based, Template::Toolkit design.  User interface performed six times faster}

  2002-04--2005-06
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Tracked top 5 issues quarter to quarter. After 3 quarters of implementation, support calls dropped, on average, 100 cases per quarter}
    \item{Identified training gaps: created training and delivered to employees in 3 theatres}
    \item{Moved client satisfaction rating from 74 to 95 percent, the highest seen to that date}
    \item{Developed lead + application owner support relationship still in use today. After performing liaison role, messaging team requested my transition to their team}

\section*{Code Sample}





\subsubsection*{VerbaLatina}

{\bf Category:} Linguistics  {\bf Language:} Ruby {\bf Audience:} Linguists and Latin Students

{\bf Homepage:} {\tt https://github.com/sgharms/verbalatina/tree/master}
\vspace{0.05in}

A Rails application that wraps a library set that programmatically conjugates regular Latin Verbs from 4 principal parts into all verbal parts, moods, persons, etc.




\subsubsection*{Linguistics Package}

{\bf Category:} Linguistics  {\bf Language:} Ruby {\bf Audience:} Linguists and Latin Students

{\bf Homepage:} {\tt http://github.com/bruce/linguistics/tree/master}
\vspace{0.05in}

Linguistics is a framework for building linguistic utilities for Ruby objects
in any language. It includes a generic language-independant front end, a
module for mapping language codes into language names, and a module which
contains various English-language utilities





\subsubsection*{CMailguard}

{\bf Category:} Sysadmin  {\bf Language:} Perl {\bf Audience:} Mail systems administrators

{\bf Homepage:} {\tt http://code.google.com/p/cmailguard/}
\vspace{0.05in}

For mail architectures that are highly distributed, consolidating mails and running elgibility-to-send to certain addresses is difficult and problematic.  Mailguard is designed such that addresses can be routed to a central server. Upon reaching the server, the data is sent via STDOUT into the mailguard application.  The application then classifies the sender and based on configuration parameters decides whether the mail should be silently discarded, forwarded on, or put into a holding pen until the message can be validated by a moderator.




\subsubsection*{M4Resume}

{\bf Category:} Productivity  {\bf Language:} M4 {\bf Audience:} Geeky job-seekers

{\bf Homepage:} {\tt https://github.com/sgharms/m4resume/tree}
\vspace{0.05in}

Tool for writing résumés in M4, and then having it flexibly build them into a variety of formats:  \LaTeX, XHTML, and XHTML+RDFa.




\subsubsection*{latintools}

{\bf Category:} Linguistics  {\bf Language:} Ruby {\bf Audience:} Classicists

{\bf Homepage:} {\tt https://github.com/sgharms/verbalatina/tree/master}
