<h2 id="Introducti">Introduction</h2>

<p>RDFa is a thin layer of markup you can add to your web pages that makes them
understandable for machines as well as people. You could describe it as a CSS
for meaning. By adding it, browsers, search engines, and other software can
understand more about the pages, and in so doing offer more services or better
results for the user. For instance, if a browser knows that a page is about an
event such as a conference, it can offer to add it to your calendar, show it on
a map, locate hotels or flights, or any number of other things.</p>

<p>This document introduces RDFa and gives examples of its use.</p>

<h2 id="ASimpleSearchForm">Metadata in HTML</h2>

<p>If you know HTML markup, you will know that you can add metadata to an HTML
document by adding <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
elements in the head. For instance:</p>
<pre>&lt;meta name="description" content="A site about fish" /&gt;</pre>

<p>gives a description of the current document. You could say that the current
page has a <code>description</code> property, whose value is "<code>A site
about fish</code>".</p>

<p>Similarly you can say:</p>
<pre>&lt;link rel="next" href="thecod.html" /&gt;</pre>

<p>which says that if you consider this page as one in a series of pages, the
next one is <code>thecod.html</code>. In other words, this page has a
<code>next</code> relation to <code>thecod.html</code>.</p>

<p>There are a smattering of other places in HTML where you can add some
metadata, such as the <code>title</code> element and attribute in places, and
the <code>cite</code> attribute on <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> and others,
but that is about it.</p>

<p>In passing, you might wonder why you can't say</p>
<pre>&lt;meta name="description"&gt;A site about fish&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>

<p>and the answer is simply that at the time this feature was added to HTML,
some browsers would incorrectly have displayed the text in the meta element,
even though it was in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and so to prevent that
happening the content was put in an attribute instead (this, by the way, is
being fixed in XHTML2).</p>

<h2 id="Metadata">The Use of Metadata</h2>

<p>Typically the metadata in a document is used for several purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <code>title</code> element can provide a title for windows and
    bookmarks,</li>
  <li>the <code>title</code> <em>attribute</em> can provide a hover-over
    information pop-up,</li>
  <li>search engines can use the <code>description</code> property in search
    results,</li>
  <li>some browsers provide a navigation bar with the values of the
    <code>next</code>, <code>prev</code> and other properties so that you can
    navigate between the different pages, or see the copyright information
    about a page</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on.</p>

<h2 id="Generalise">RDF: A Generalised Way of Representing Metadata</h2>

<p>In the time since the <code>meta</code> element was added to HTML, a
generalised way of representing metadata has been defined at W3C. This is
called <em>RDF</em>, the resource description framework ('resource' roughly
speaking means 'document' here, but you'll see examples of other things than
documents later).</p>

<p>RDF is a <em>very</em> simple framework. Essentially all knowledge is
gathered as assertions of the form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>URI ‚Äî property ‚Äî value</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where 'URI' is the URI of the thing being described, 'property' is (the URI
of) a property, and 'value' is the value that that property can take, either
another URI, a literal string, or a chunk of XML.</p>

<p>So assuming the example document above has a URL of
<code>http://www.example.com/home.html</code>, then the RDF assertion, or
<em>triple</em> as it is often called, for the <em>description</em> property
is</p>
<pre class="html">http://www.example.com/home.html ‚Äî [html:description] ‚Äî "A site about fish"</pre>

<p>and the RDF triple for the <em>next</em> relation would be</p>
<pre class="html">http://www.example.com/home.html ‚Äî [html:next] ‚Äî http://www.example.com/thecod.html</pre>

<p>The value <code>[html:next]</code> means here "the url that represents the
HTML <em>next</em> property", and is expressed here as a <em>Compact URI</em>
or <em>CURIE</em> for short. More on those later.</p>

<h2 id="Extending">Extending Metadata in XHTML</h2>

<p>RDFa extends the possibilities of metadata in XHTML, by generalising the
attributes on <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code> and allowing them to be
used on <em>any</em> element, not just <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code>
(so that you may now have metadata in the body of the page as well as the head)
and then defining how those attributes can be interpreted as RDF.</p>

<p>To take a simple example, many people add a number of so-called <em>Dublin
Core</em> properties to their pages, such as <em>title</em> and <em>author</em>
(which is called <em>creator</em> in Dublin Core, since the properties can be
used with other things, such as paintings):</p>

<div>

<div>
<pre>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head <strong>profile="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/"</strong>&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;John Smith's Fish of the World&lt;/title&gt;
   <strong>&lt;meta name="DC.title" content="Fish of the World"/&gt;</strong>
   <strong>&lt;meta name="DC.creator" content="John Smith"/&gt;</strong>
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Fish of the World&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;by John Smith&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>The <em>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</em> organization defined these and
other properties for defining the metadata about books, works of art and so on.
You can see in the example above that they duplicate information in the
document itself. A nice thing about RDFa is that you can attach the properties
to the document text instead:</p>
<pre>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      <strong>xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"</strong>&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;John Smith's Fish of the World&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1 <strong>property="dc:title"</strong>&gt;Fish of the World&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;by &lt;span <strong>property="dc:creator"</strong>&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>What this does is declare that we are going to use the Dublin Core
properties, and prefix them with <code>dc:</code>. It then attaches the Dublin
Core properties <code>title</code> and <code>creator</code> to the relevant
parts of the text. Of course, a major advantage of this is that the visible
versions in the text don't get out of sync with the metadata versions.</p>

<h2 id="Compact">Compact URIs</h2>

<p>In the last example we had <code>property="dc:title"</code>. This says "the
property called <em>title</em> from the vocabulary identified by <em>dc:</em>".
But we also said earlier that a property was kept as a URI. A form such as
<code>dc:title</code> is called a <em>Compact URI</em>, or <em>CURIE</em> for
short. The URI it represents is just the concatenation of the URI in the
declaration of the prefix (in this case
<code>xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"</code>) and whatever follows
the colon. So in this case <code>dc:title</code> is a short form of the full
URI <code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title</code>. (You can now probably
see why CURIEs are nice to have.)</p>

<p>In the case that there is no prefix (as in the case of something like
<code>rel="index"</code>), then a default prefix is used. For XHTML that
default is <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Using">Using <code>rel</code></h2>

<p>Using the <code>property</code> attribute like this gives you an equivalent
of the <code>meta</code> element, but then in the text of your page. To get the
equivalent of a <code>link</code> element, you use the <code>rel</code>
attribute. For instance, pages often have a clickable "Next" link to take you
to the next page:</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="thecod.html"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>It can be expressed like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="thecod.html" rel="next"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>Similarly, </p>
<pre>&lt;a href="page2.html"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>can be written</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="page2.html" rel="prev"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>Another typical use for <em>rel</em> is to use it to point to the copyright
or licensing information of a page. Instead of:</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="copyright.html"&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>You can write</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="copyright.html" rel="copyright"&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>(By the way, it doesn't matter what order you put the <code>href</code> and
<code>rel</code> in.)</p>

<p>Of course, you could already do this in HTML. What is new is that it is now
defined how to interpret this as RDF, and, as you will later see, you can apply
it to more than just <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<h2 id="Talking">Talking about Other Documents</h2>

<p>Most of the metadata in HTML only allows you to talk about the document
itself, and in all the examples we have given so far, we have been giving
metadata about the page in question. But you may want to be able to talk about
other things than just the current document (and you will see more examples of
this shortly).</p>

<p>For this you can use the <code>about</code> attribute to specify what it is
the information applies to. For instance, suppose you link to some data:</p>
<pre>Here is a plot of the data: &lt;img src="plot.png" alt="Rainfall 1900-1999"/&gt;.
The &lt;a href="rainfall.csv"&gt;raw data&lt;/a&gt; is available.</pre>

<p>and you want to include the licensing conditions of that data:</p>
<pre>The data is available under &lt;a href="license.html"&gt;these conditions&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>

<p>then you can say this:</p>
<pre>The data is available under
&lt;a <strong>about="rainfall.csv" rel="license"</strong> href="license.html"&gt;these conditions&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>

<p>If you use <code>about</code> on a container element, like a
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> then the <em>about</em> applies to all the contained
relations:</p>
<pre>&lt;p <strong>about="rainfall.csv"</strong>&gt;
   The data &lt;strong property="dc:title"&gt;Rainfall 1900-1999&lt;/strong&gt;
   is the property of &lt;em property="dc:creator"&gt;Data Be We, Inc&lt;/em&gt;
   and is available under
   &lt;a rel="license" href="license.html"&gt;these conditions&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<h2 id="Using1">Using URIs and CURIEs in the <code>about</code> attribute</h2>

<p>Note that the <code>about</code> attribute contains a URI. It can point to
anything on the Web:</p>
<pre>&lt;p <strong>about="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax"</strong>&gt;The title of the RDFa specification is
  &lt;em property="dc:title"&gt;RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Occasionally you may want to use a CURIE instead of a URI in
<code>about</code> (as you will see shortly), and so to distinguish a CURIE
from a URI in those cases, you enclose a CURIE in square brackets. For
instance, suppose you had defined
<code>xmlns:tr="http://www.w3.org/TR/"</code>, then you could write the above
in the following way:</p>
<pre>&lt;p about="<strong>[tr:rdfa-syntax]</strong>"&gt;The title of the RDFa specification is
  &lt;em property="dc:title"&gt;RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<h2 id="Talking1">Talking about People, Places and Things</h2>

<p>Up to now we have been talking about assigning properties to things with
URIs. But there is a problem: not everything that you might want to talk about
has a URI. The city of Amsterdam doesn't have a URI. Nor does a person, or an
object like a car, or a concept like <em>love</em>. Of course, these things
have pages <em>about</em> them, but that is different. It is important not to
confuse a website <em>about</em> something with that thing itself.</p>

<p>To take an example to explain the difference, suppose we want to say that
T.S. Eliot is the author of the poem <em>The Waste Land</em>. Well, we might do
a search for the poem, and find
<code>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waste_Land</code>. You might then be
tempted to say:</p>
<pre>&lt;span about="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waste_Land"
      property="dc:creator"&gt;T.S. Eliot&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this says that T.S. Eliot created the Wikipedia page, which
is patently not true. So what do we do?</p>

<p>Well, RDFa has a notation that allows you to create a local name for
something that doesn't have a URI (or that has a URI that you don't know), and
say something about it anyway:</p>
<pre>&lt;link <strong>about="[_:TheWasteLand]"</strong> rel="foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf"
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waste_Land" /&gt;</pre>

<p>The "_:" is a reserved prefix for this notation. You can put any identifier
after the colon. What this says is "There is something (which we shall call
'TheWasteLand') which is the <em>primary topic</em> of the page at
<code>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waste_Land</code>."</p>

<p>Now that we have uniquely identified the poem we can record that its creator
was 'T.S. Eliot'":</p>
<pre>&lt;span about="[_:TheWasteLand]" property="dc:creator"&gt;T.S. Eliot&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

<p>(By the way, the foaf properties are identified by
<code>xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"</code>).</p>

<p>In this way we can mint all sorts of names for people, places, organizations
and other things that haven't got URIs, and uniquely identify them. A
person:</p>
<pre>&lt;link about="[_:StevenPemberton]"
      rel="foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf" href="http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/" /&gt;</pre>

<p>A place:</p>
<pre>&lt;link about="[_:Amsterdam]"
      rel="foaf:isPrimarytopicOf" href="http://www.amsterdam.nl/" /&gt;</pre>

<p>An organization:</p>
<pre>&lt;link about="[_:W3C]"
      rel="foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf" href="http://www.w3.org/" /&gt;</pre>

<p>And then we can use those names in order to talk about them:</p>
<pre>&lt;a about="[_:W3C]" rel="foaf:homepage" href="http://www.w3.org/"&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>These special CURIEs beginning "_:" are called <em>blank nodes</em> or
<em>bnodes.</em> Note that they are local to a document, so you have to
redeclare them in each document that you use them.</p>

<p>By the way, the important thing with blank nodes is to uniquely identify
them by some means if you can. <code>foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf</code> is one way,
but any property that is unique will work. For instance:</p>
<pre>&lt;link about="[_:StevenPemberton]" rel="foaf:mbox" href="mailto:steven@w3.org" /&gt;</pre>

<p>is just as good, since there is only one person who has that email address,
and so we have uniquely identified that person.</p>

<p>Note that since an empty URI "" means 'the current page', on your own home
page you can add code like</p>
<pre>&lt;link about="[_:StevenPemberton]" rel="foaf:primaryTopicOf" href=""/&gt;</pre>

<p>which says "The thing we call StevenPemberton is the primary topic of this
page".</p>

<h2 id="Overriding">Overriding the Content</h2>

<p>Sometimes although the content contains information that needs to be tagged,
it is not always in the form you need it. For instance:</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam is located
    at latitude 52¬∞22'23"N and longitude 4¬∞53'32"E&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>While there are properties for recording latitude and longitude, they expect
the values to be decimal numbers. Well we can write this:</p>
<pre>&lt;p <strong>about="[_:Amsterdam]"</strong>&gt;&lt;span property="dc:name"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/span&gt; is located
   at latitude &lt;span <strong>property="geo:lat" content="52.373"</strong>&gt;52¬∞22'23"N&lt;/span&gt;
 and longitude &lt;span <strong>property="geo:long" content="4.892"</strong>&gt;4¬∞53'32"E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>This is of course the same <code>content</code><code></code>attribute you
know from the <code>meta</code> element. Its value overrides whatever is in the
content of the element.</p>

<p>(The geo properties are at
<code>xmlns:geo="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"</code>)</p>

<h2 id="Swapping">Swapping subject and object</h2>

<p>A lesser-used but nevertheless useful relationship in HTML is the
<em>reverse relationship</em> <code>rev</code>. This relationship is like
<code>rel</code>, but reverses the relationship. For instance, if a document
<code>doc.html</code> is indexed by the page <code>index.html</code>, then
<code>doc.html</code> can record this fact with the link:</p>
<pre>&lt;link rel="index" href="index.html"/&gt;</pre>

<p>However, <code>index.html</code> can also record the relationship:</p>
<pre>&lt;link <strong>rev</strong>="index" href="doc.html"/&gt;</pre>

<p>which says "this page is the index for doc.html".</p>

<p>You can use <code>rev</code> similarly in RDFa. All it does is swap the
subject (the 'about') with the object (the 'href'). For instance, suppose we
have a set of data about a person:</p>
<pre>&lt;p about="[_:StevenPemberton]"&gt;
   Name: &lt;span property="foaf:name"&gt;Steven Pemberton&lt;/span&gt;
   Mail: &lt;a rel="foaf:mbox" href="mailto:steven@w3.org"&gt;steven@w3.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Now, foaf has a property <code>img</code> that says that a particular image
is a picture of some person. But the relationship is from the picture, to the
person. What we would like to say is:</p>
<pre>&lt;link about="Steven.jpg" rel="foaf:img" href="[_:StevenPemberton]"/&gt;</pre>

<p>except that at the moment we are talking about the person, and not the
image. So if we want to add this information to the block above, we just
reverse the relationship with <code>rev</code>:</p>
<pre>&lt;p about="[_:StevenPemberton]"&gt;
   Name: &lt;span property="foaf:name"&gt;Steven Pemberton&lt;/span&gt;
   Mail: &lt;a rel="foaf:mbox" href="mailto:steven@w3.org"&gt;steven@w3.org&lt;/a&gt;
   Mugshot: &lt;a <strong>rev="foaf:img"</strong> href="Steven.jpg"&gt;Photo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Note that you can have (if you want) both rel and rev on an element:</p>
<pre>&lt;a rel="next" rev="prev" href="page2.html"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>(Not that this example gives you very much in terms of extra
information!)</p>

<h2 id="Advanced">Advanced topics</h2>

<p>You now know enough to use RDFa for day-to-day use, but there are a few
extras you might find useful.</p>

<h2 id="resource">The resource attribute</h2>

<p>Alongside the <code>href</code> attribute, there is also a
<code>resource</code> attribute with the same purpose, but usable when you
don't want the link to be clickable, or you want to use a CURIE (since you
can't use a CURIE in <code>href</code>):</p>
<pre>The photo is entitled
  &lt;em about="Steven.jpg" rel="foaf:img" resource="[_:StevenPemberton]"&gt;Steven in London&lt;/em&gt;</pre>

<p>Note in passing that you may have more than one relation on an element. So
we could also say:</p>
<pre>The photo is entitled
  &lt;em about="Steven.jpg" rel="foaf:img" resource="[_:StevenPemberton]"
      <strong>property="dc:title"</strong>&gt;Steven in London&lt;/em&gt;</pre>

<p></p>

<h2 id="Packaging">Packaging a group of relations</h2>

<p>Often a group of properties together make up a whole. For instance an event
can have a title, a description, a location, and a start and end date. If you
want to say that a section of markup contains such a group of properties, you
can use the <code>typeof</code> attribute. For instance, to mark up a
conference:</p>
<pre>&lt;div xmlns:event="http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal#" <strong>typeof="event:Vevent</strong><strong>"</strong>&gt;
     &lt;h3 property="event:summary"&gt;WWW 2009&lt;/h3&gt;
     &lt;p property="event:description"&gt;18th International World Wide Web Conference&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;To be held from
        &lt;span property="event:dtstart" content="2009-04-20"&gt;20th April 2009&lt;/span&gt;
        until &lt;span property="event:dtend" content="2009-04-24"&gt;24th April&lt;/span&gt;,
        in &lt;span property="event:location"&gt;Madrid, Spain&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>or a TV program:</p>
<pre>&lt;div typeof="event:Vevent"&gt;
    &lt;h3 property="event:summary"&gt;Have I Got Old News For You&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p property="event:location"&gt;BBC2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span property="event:dtstart" content="2008-06-28T21:00:00"&gt;Saturday 28 June,
       9pm&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span property="event:dtend" content="2008-06-28T21:30:00"&gt;9.30pm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p property="event:description"&gt;Team captains Paul Merton and Ian
       Hislop are joined by returning guest host Jeremy Clarkson and panellists
       Danny Baker and Germaine Greer for the topical news quiz.
       &lt;abbr title="in stereo"&gt;[S]&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>Note the use of <code>content</code> here to get the dates and times into a
machine-readable format.</p>

<h2 id="Data">Data Types</h2>

<p>Occasionally you may want to specify that a particular property is of a
certain data type. The <code>datatype</code> attribute is precisely for this
purpose:</p>
<pre>&lt;span property="event:dtend" datatype="xsd:date" content="2009-04-24"&gt;24th April&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

<p>This would need an
<code>xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Validating">Validating</h2>

<p>If you want to make sure your page validates correctly, you should ensure
your pages have the following at the top of the document (before the
<code>&lt;html&gt;</code>).</p>
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd"&gt;</pre>

<p>The validator at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a> will check your
pages.</p>

<h2 id="Looking">Looking at the results</h2>

<p>There are a number of online services willing to extract all the properties
from a RDFa-enabled page, and tell you what they are. For instance, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/">RDFa Distiller</a> at
http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/.</p>

<h2 id="Summary">Summary of Attributes</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>about</dt>
    <dd>Specifies the subject of a relationship. If not given, then the subject
      is the current document.</dd>
  <dt>rel</dt>
    <dd>Defines a relation between the subject and a URL given by either
      <code>href</code> or <code>resource</code>. The subject is either
      specified by the closest about or src attribute, @@</dd>
  <dt>rev</dt>
    <dd>The same as the the rel attribute, except that subject and object are
      reversed.</dd>
  <dt>property</dt>
    <dd>Defines a relationship between the subject and either a string (if the
      <code>content</code> attribute is present) or a piece of markup otherwise
      (the content of the element that the property attribute is on).</dd>
  <dt>content</dt>
    <dd>Specifies a string to use as an object for the <code>property</code>
      attribute</dd>
  <dt>href</dt>
    <dd>Specifies an object URI for the <code>rev</code> and <code>rel</code>
      attributes. Takes precedence over the <code>resource</code>
    attribute.</dd>
  <dt>resource</dt>
    <dd>Specifies an object URI for the <code>rev</code> and <code>rel</code>
      attributes if <code>href</code> is not present.</dd>
  <dt>src</dt>
    <dd>Specifies the subject of a relationship.</dd>
  <dt>datatype</dt>
    <dd>Specifies a datatype of the object of the <code>property</code>
      attribute (either in the <code>content</code> attribute, or the content
      of the element that the <code>datattype</code> attribute is on.) By
      default, data in the content attribute is of type <code>string</code>,
      and data in the content of an element has type <code>xml:Literal</code>.
      If <code>datatype=""</code> is used, then for the RDF the element content
      is stripped of markup, and is of type string.</dd>
  <dt>typeof</dt>
    <dd>Creates a blank node, which becomes the subject, and asserts that the
      current element contains relationships that match the given RDF type.</dd>
